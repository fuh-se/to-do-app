A simple todo app created in React

1. Todo-App consists of two components
    a. Incomplete Task
    b. Completed Task

    Incomplete task displays existing and new tasks that are added. User can click on button or check and click to add in completed task list

    Completed task displays all tasks that are marked as completed by the user.

2. The Todo app uses callback functions to orchestrate with other components respectively.

3. New tasks can be added/created by clicking on "Add Task" button which will be displayed in incompleted list.

4. Completed tasks can be deleted by the user by clicking on the 'delete' button

5. Thank you.
